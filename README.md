**Basic Forms in HTML**

This project provides a simple HTML template showcasing basic form elements for user registration. The form includes input fields for the user's name, email, and password, as well as a submit button to send the data. This example demonstrates how forms are structured in HTML, using tags such as form, input, label, and button.

The form is designed with the required attribute, which ensures that the user must fill in all necessary information before submission. It also uses the type="email" and type="password" attributes to define specific input types for email and password fields, respectively, helping with data validation.

By opening the index.html file in a browser, users can see how the form works and understand how the HTML structure facilitates data collection and submission. This template is perfect for beginners who want to learn how to create and manage forms in HTML.

Feel free to use this project as a foundation for creating more complex forms or as a reference when learning HTML form elements. It's a straightforward starting point for anyone new to web development.
